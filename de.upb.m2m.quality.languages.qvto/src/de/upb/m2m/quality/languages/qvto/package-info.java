/**
 * This package specifies all QVT-O-specific configurations needed for measuring
 * M2M quality metrics in QVT-O. It handles the location of involved metamodels
 * and models, names of languages, lines of code measurements, and
 * transformations between QVT-O AST representations and metric models.
 * 
 * This plug-in provides an extension for the "Language" extension point 
 * (with ID "de.upb.m2m.quality.languages"). Therefore, this plug-in plugs into
 * the M2M Quality Metrics Framework and extends it by a support for
 * transformations specified within QVT-O.
 * 
 * @version 0.1
