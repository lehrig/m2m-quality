/**
 * Constitutes the core of the M2M Quality framework. The framework is mainly
 * based on a work flow that parses each language of interest to create a
 * language-specific AST model and transforming it to a quality metrics model.
 * 
 * The package itself includes classes for managing the plug-in's life-cycle 
 * (M2MQualityConfigurationPlugin class) and storing configuration properties
 * for the work flow (M2MQualityConfiguration class). The "jobs" subpackage
 * includes the implementations of the work flow consisting of several jobs.
 * 
 * @version 0.1
