This folder includes:

1) launch configurations for the Java and QVT-O transformations
   (There are no launch configurations for QVT-R transformations 
   because mediniQVT's launch configurations do not provide the 
   functionality to save the configuration to a file.)

2) launch configurations for the metric measurements of the
   case studies. Their output goes to the "de.upb.m2m.quality.
   casestudies.results" plugin.
